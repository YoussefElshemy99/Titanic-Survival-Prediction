# Titanic Survival Prediction

🚢 **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
A fun and educational machine learning project where you predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster! 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)

## 🎯 Goal
Build and evaluate multiple classifiers on the Titanic dataset (containing real passenger data) to predict survival outcomes.

## 🔍 Dataset
- **Training Data**: `train.csv` (contains passenger details + survival labels)
- **Test Data**: `test.csv` (unseen passengers for final predictions)
- **New Passengers**: Custom dataset for real-world inference

## 📌 Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize survival trends.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extract meaningful insights (e.g., family size, title extraction).
3. **Model Training** – Compare Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Select the best-performing model.
5. **Prediction** – Deploy the model to predict survival for new passengers.

## 🛠️ Workflow
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature engineering.
- **Classification Models** – Implementing and comparing different ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naïve Bayes).
- **Performance Evaluation** – Analyzing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best model.
- **New Passenger Prediction** – Using the best-trained model to predict survival for unseen passengers.

## 🚀 How to Contribute
- Clone the repo and experiment with different models!
- Submit issues or PRs for improvements.
